Any machine learning problem needs to be solved with a few basic procedures. First and foremost, determining the requirements of the problems in terms of the type of data and algorithm that will address them is the most important phase. Second, an adequate understanding of aggregated data is necessary, as is the subsequent preprocessing and exploratory analysis. Finally, a predictive model is developed employing the prepared data, evaluated using real-world scenarios, and then deployed.
