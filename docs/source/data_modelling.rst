Data Modelling
==============

Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system

Approaches
^^^^^^^^^^

* Supervised learning

    * Regression
    * Classification
    
* Unsupervised learning
* Semi-supervised learning

Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^

* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines
* Regressional Analysis
* Bayesian Network
* Genetic Algorithms
* Artificial Neural Network
